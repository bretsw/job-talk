# Introduction

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

---

# Networked learning

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/network.jpg")
```

--

I study networked learning in online communities.

--

My work is **broad** in terms of methods and contexts

--

yet **focused** on some core questions 

---

# Possibilities and perils

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/caution.jpg")
```

--

These questions conjure **possibilities** of the best of what could be, 

--

but also **perils** of what has been and worst-case scenarios. 

---

# Learning analytics

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/code.jpg")
```

**Data science and learning analytics** techniques have helped me make sense of, and answer, some core questions around networked learning in online communities.

---

# Definition: Networked learning

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/computer.jpg")
```

**Possibilities:**

--

- The internet creates novel social and environmental conditions for learning

--

- Especially *ad hoc*, *self-directed*, *just-in-time* learning

--

**Perils:**

--

- This learning is *informal* (shallow?)

---

# Definition: Online communities

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/computer.jpg")
```

**Possibilities:**

--

- Emphasis on shared affinity, not resemblance to traditional communities

--

- e.g., Facebook group, Twitter hashtag, subreddit

--

**Perils:**

--

- These communities are *chaotic* (disjointed?)

---

# Definition: Digital traces

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/computer.jpg")
```

**Possibilities:**

--

- Residual, observable evidence of online activity

--

- e.g., tweets, forum posts, user profiles

--

**Perils:**

--

- This evidence is *noisy* (indecipherable?)

---

# Learning analytics

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/order.jpg")
```

**Data science and learning analytics** techniques have helped me:

--

- Find *meaning* in the informal

--

- See *order* in the chaos

--

- *Listen* through the noise

---

# Learning analytics

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/code.jpg")
```

**Data science and learning analytics** techniques have allowed me to investigate networked learning in online communities by:

--

- Studying real world, in situ data in massive quantities

--

- Identifying patterns and trends

--

-	Inferring possibilities and perils

**Context:** Twitter (\#Edchat hashtag)

--

**Possibilities and perils:** 

--

**Data Collection:** 1,228,506 \#Edchat tweets

--

**Analysis:** tweet type classification, discourse analysis 

---

# Tweet example

```{r, out.width = "540", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/tweet-example.png")
```

---

# Twitter hashtags

```{r, out.width = "180px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/hashtag.jpg")
```

--

**Many different uses of Twitter hashtags:**

--

- Topical index: #Teaching

--

- Humor and wit: #CoolTeacher

--

- Synchronous chats: #SatChat

--

- "Space" for ongoing discussions: #Edchat, #ITeachMath

---

# \#Edchat background

```{r, out.width = "180px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/hashtag.jpg")
```

--

- \#Edchat is one of the oldest and busiest educational Twitter hashtags

--

- \#Edchat is self-described as:

> "...Twitter discussion that any educator can discuss and learn about current teaching trends, to integrate technology, to transform their education, and to connect with inspiring instructors around the world."

--

**Context:** Twitter (\#Edchat hashtag)

--

**Possibilities and perils:** 

--

**Data Collection:** 589,770 \#Edchat tweets spanning 2019 and 2020

--

**Analysis:** trend analysis, natural language processing, topic modeling

---

# Twitter during COVID-19

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

### Findings

--

- Across all topics in both years, terms like edtech, learn(-ing), teach(-ing or -er), and school were common

--

- **2019:** Two topics related to new K-12 resources, two topics on teaching, and one specifcally on reading

--

- **2020:** Two topics communicating a sense of urgency (Topics 1, 2), two topics specifically related to pandemic themes, and one appealing to fellow educators (i.e., "edutwitter") for free classroom resources

---

# Twitter during COVID-19

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

</p>

<hr>

--

**Context:** Reddit (themed discussion forums called *subreddits*)

--

**Possibilities and perils:** Online participation can change quickly, meaning a snapshot may be misleading

--

**Data Collection:** 1,036,278 Reddit posts and comments from two subreddits, spanning 3.5 years

--

**Analysis:** trend analysis, natural language processing, social network analysis

---

# Change over time

(bar graph: response rate in r/education)

---

# Change over time

(bar graph: thread length in r/education)

---

# Change over time

**Teachers come together through social media in a variety of ways:**

--

- For just-in-time professional development through an emergency response network (Greenhow, Staudt Willet, & Galvin, in revision)

--

- To self-direct their professional learning (Staudt Willet & Carpenter, in press)

--

- To find and share teaching resources (Greenhow, Staudt Willet, & Galvin, in revision; Staudt Willet, 2019; Staudt Willet & Carpenter, in press)

--

- To vent and seek emotional support (Greenhow, Staudt Willet, & Galvin, in revision; Staudt Willet, 2019; Staudt Willet & Carpenter, in press)

---

# Perils

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/caution.jpg")
```

--

-	Individual contributors can overwhelm the community with their **volume** (Carpenter, Staudt Willet, Koehler, & Greenhalgh, 2019) or **self-promotional nature** (Staudt Willet, 2019) of content

--

- Participants' professional and private lives can be brought together in potentially undesired ways (Staudt Willet & Carpenter, in press)

--

-	Participants can be put at risk due to platforms (and researchers) treatment of data privacy and profit model (Krutka, Heath, & Staudt Willet, 2019)

include_graphics("img/transition.jpg")
```

--

My past work has shown that data science and learning analytics techniques can bring important insight into networked learning in online communities

--

More work is needed to understand **learning during transitions**:

--

- Disaster response: e.g., pandemics (in progress)

--

- Job transitions: e.g., new teachers, new faculty, promotions (in progress)

--

- Skill development: e.g., educational data science (in progress)

# Future research: Perils

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/ethics.png")
```

--

More work is needed around some of the perils I've identified:

--

- **Equity:**

  - Understanding the motivations and partcipation of "lurkers"
  
--
  
  - Recommendations for social media users
  
--

- **Ethics:**

  - Balancing privacy and open science (Rosenberg & Staudt Willet, in press)
  
--

  - Accountability for tech companies

---

# Future research: Tools

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/construction.jpg")
```

More work is needed **to keep building and improving** these works-in-progress:

--

- R packages for data collection and analysis (Twitter, Reddit)

--

- Web apps for classifying learning spaces (Twitter, Reddit)

---

# Conclusion

---

# Interdisciplinary research

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

This work brings together ideas from numerous disciplines:

--

- Learning analytics and data science

--

- Emerging technologies

--

- Information science

--

- Teacher education and teacher learning


---

# Final thoughts

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

- Affordances and constraints of the internet create novel social and environmental conditions for learning

--

- These can be studied through data science and learning analytics techniques

--

- This advanced learning technology is worth further study and investment
