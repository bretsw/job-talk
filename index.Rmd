# Background

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

---

# Networked learning

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/network.jpg")
```

--

The internet is an advanced learning technology

--

whose affordances and constraints create novel social and environmental conditions for learning

---

# Networked learning

### My research agenda:

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/social-media.jpg")
```

--

To better understand the **possibilities** and **perils** of networked learning in online communities

--

through data science and learning analytics approaches

---

# Networked learning possibilities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/chat.jpg")
```

--

**Why** do teachers come together through social media?

--

- to self-direct their professional learning

--

- to find and share teaching resources

--

- to vent and seek emotional support

---

# Networked learning possibilities

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/purpose.jpg")
```

--

**When** do teachers come together through social media?

--

- Developing new skills

--

- Adopting new curriculum or standards

--

- Transitioning to a new job

--

- Navigating COVID-19 disruptions

---

# Networked learning perils

```

"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they *could*, they didn't stop to think if they *should*." ~ Dr. Ian Malcolm, *Jurassic Park*

--

-	Demands for time, energy, cognitive load can overwhelm agency

--

- Context collapse

--

-	Data privacy, commodification of users

---

# Interdisciplinary research

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/purpose.jpg")
```

This work is brings together ideas from numerous disciplines:

--

- Learning analytics and data science

--

- Emerging technologies

--

- Information science

--

- Teacher education and teacher learning

---

# Multiple methods

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/csed-graph.png")
```

This work analyzes **digital traces** in a variety of ways:

--

- **Contribution trends**

--

- **Text analysis**: sentiment, discourse, natural language processing

--

- **Text classification**: topic modeling  (log odds ratio, PCA topics), machine learning (logistic regression classifier)

--

- **Social network analysis**: visual, descriptive (reciprocity, transitivity), inferential (influence, selection, spin glass clustering)

**Data collection of digital traces:**

--

- **3.5 years** (42 months): from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019

--

- More than a million Reddit contributions spanning three-and-a-half years:

--

  - 54,933 posts and 641,727 comments in **r/Teachers** from 55,148 users

--

  - 252,340 posts and 87,278 comments in **r/education** from 43,711 users

# Different spaces, purposes

### Project A: Teaching-related subreddits

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/reddit-logo.png")
```

**Analysis:** Trends over 3.5 years &mdash; five quantitative and qualitative measures: 

--

- **Quantitative analysis** of individual contributions, content interactions, and social interactions

--

- **Qualitative analysis** of topics of conversation and types of discourse in top-ten posts (defined by highest voting scores) in each subreddit, and up to the top-ten responses to each of these

--

- 2 subreddits x 7 time periods x 10 posts =  **140 posts**

--

- 2 subreddits x 7 time periods x 100 responses = **1,460 responses**

# Different spaces, purposes

**Daily contributions to r/Teachers and r/education**

# Different spaces, purposes

**Post topics and discourse in r/Teachers and r/education**

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

---

# Different spaces, purposes

**Change and continuity**

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/threads.jpg")
```

--

- **r/Teachers:** Individual contributions increased steadily, clustering decreased, mutuality increased, topics consistently included teachersâ€™ lived experiences and pedagogy
  
--

- **r/education:** Posts and posters declined, thread length increased, clustering decreased, mutuality increased, topics consistently included education policy and societal factors
  
---

# Different spaces, purposes

**Distinct purposes**

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/social-media.jpg")
```

--

- **r/Teachers:** a conversational space or a teachersâ€™ lounge 

--

  - many responses, long threads, educators' lived experiences

--

- **r/education:** a bulletin board space or a debate hall

--

  - many posts, few responses, more content-focused

---

# Different spaces, purposes

**Significance**

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/scatter.jpg")
```

--

- Teachers' self-directed learning is tied to context and has a temporal dimension

--

- Need to advise aspiring teachers how best to combine different spaces for maximum effect

--

- There is value to anonymous spaces for educators

--

  - Example: Place to vent and unburden emotions from COVID-19 disruptions and frustrations

---

# Different spaces, purposes

### Project A: Teaching-related subreddits

**Conclusion**

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/across-time.jpg")
```

--

- Self-directed learning on Reddit is different than visiting a library

--

- Educators must work to become critical consumers of ideas and materials encountered in online spaces 

--

- Educators, instructional designers, and scholars must continue to reflect upon and analyze both opportunities and challenges of self-directed learning in the complex ecologies of social media spaces

**Framework: Professional learning networks (PLNs)**

```{r, out.width = "420x", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/network.jpg")
```

--

PLNs are systems of: 

--

- interpersonal **connections** 

--

- and **resources** (knowledge, skills, curricular materials, and encouragement)

--

- that support **informal learning**

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has resulted in economic and social disruption of an unprecedented scale.

--

Is Twitter a flexible and adaptable part of teachers' PLNs?

--

**Questions:**

1. How, if it all, did participation in #Edchat change during COVID-19?
1. What questions did teachers ask in #Edchat during COVID-19?

# Future research

### Networked learning in online communities

My past work has shown that data science and learning analytics techniques can bring important insight into teachers' professional learning through social media

---

# Future research

### Networked learning in online communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/transition.jpg")
```

More work is needed to understand **learning during transitions**:

--

- Disaster response (e.g., pandemics)

--

- Job transitions (e.g., new teachers, new faculty, promotions)

--

- Skill development (e.g., educational data science)
  
---

# Future research

### Networked learning in online communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/ethics.png")
```

More work is needed around **technoethics**:

--

- Balancing privacy and open science
  
--

- Recommendations for social media users and dissemination of research
  
--

- Accountability for tech companies

---

# Future research

### Networked learning in online communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

More work is needed **to keep building and improving** these works-in-progress:

--

- R packages for data collection and analysis (Twitter, Reddit)

--

- Web apps for classifying learning spaces (Twitter, Reddit)

---

# Networked learning

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

--

- Affordances and constraints of the internet create novel social and environmental conditions for learning

- These can be studied through data science and learning analytics techniques

--

- This advanced learning technology is worth further study and investment
