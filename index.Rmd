# Introduction

**Networked Learning in Online Communities**

---

# Networked learning

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/network.jpg")
```

--

- **Definition:** The learning supported by the novel social and environmental conditions created by the internet

--

  - Especially *self-directed* and *just-in-time* (i.e., as needed) learning

--

- **Examples:** searching for curricular materials, looking for peers to discuss ideas for a lesson, seeking out encouragement after a tough day

---

# Online communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/computer.jpg")
```

--

- **Definition:** A group coming together online around a shared affinity

--

  - This often occurs *informally*, in a *self-organized* way

--

  - May not resemble a traditional, offline community (e.g., local neighborhood, civic organization)

--

- **Examples:** Facebook group, Twitter hashtag, subreddit

---

# Possibilities and perils

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/caution.jpg")
```

Networked learning in online communities raises both **possibilities** and **perils**

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Methods

---

#  Digital traces

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/purpose.jpg")
```

--

- **Definition:** Residual, observable evidence of online activity

--

- **Examples:** tweets, forum posts, user profiles

---

# Learning analytics

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/code.jpg")
```

**Data science and learning analytics** techniques have allowed me to:

--

- Study real world, *in situ* data in massive quantities

--

- Identify patterns and trends in messy datasets

--

-	Infer possibilities and perils

---

# Flexible tools

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/R-logo.png")
```

--

- Large datasets do not open in Excel, so I learned **R**

--

  - programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics


- Numerous *packages*:

--

  - **ggplot2** for data visualization
  
--
  
  - **igraph** for social network analysis
  
--
  
  - **caret** for machine learning

---

# New tools

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/package.png")
```

--

Sometimes, the tools you need don't exist yet.

--

- I wanted to make data collection and analysis easier for others, so I built an R software package: **tidytags**

--

- Currently in revision with ROpenSci: "best in class" software tools

--

- Freely available at https://bretsw.github.io/tidytags/

# My research

---

# In sum

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/caution.jpg")
```

--

My research uses numerous **data science and learning analytics** techniques

--

to address the **possibilities** and **perils** of networked learning 

--

in a variety of contexts for online communities.

--

**Context:** Twitter (\#Edchat hashtag)

--

**Data collection:** 1,228,506 \#Edchat tweets

--

**Data analysis:** tweet type classification, discourse analysis 

---

# Tweet example

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/tweet-example.png")
```

---

# Twitter hashtags

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/hashtag.jpg")
```

--

**Many different uses of Twitter hashtags:**

--

- Topical index: #Teaching

--

- Humor and wit: #CoolTeacher

--

- Synchronous chats: #SatChat

--

- "Space" for ongoing discussions: #Edchat, #ITeachMath

---

# \#Edchat background

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/hashtag.jpg")
```

--

- \#Edchat is one of the oldest and busiest educational Twitter hashtags

--

- \#Edchat is self-described as:

> "...Twitter discussion that any educator can discuss and learn about current teaching trends, to integrate technology, to transform their education, and to connect with inspiring instructors around the world."

</p>

<hr>

--

- Goal: Automatically detect tweet purposes through a *logistic regression classifier*

--

  - identified 39 tweet features

--

  - compared efficacy of 10 different ML methods (e.g., random forest, *k*-nearest neighbors)

---

# 1. Twitter communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/twitter-purposes.png")
```

### Possibilities

--

- Huge amount of \#Edchat content (i.e., approximately 5,000 daily tweets)

--

- Overwhelmingly on topic

--
  
- High engagement (e.g., retweeting others' content)

--

- Supports different needs

---

# 1. Twitter communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/twitter-purposes.png")
```

### Perils

--

- Imbalance of needs being supported (e.g., nearly half of new \#Edchat content is **self-promotional** in nature)

--

- Volume of content is likely overwhelming for new Twitter users or new teachers

--

- Trouble with relying on one data source (self-reports or digital traces)

# 3. Twitter chats

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/timing.png")
```

### Possibilities

--

- Community within a community: the same digital space may be used in different ways

--

- Chats generate especially high volume (muhc higher tweet density)

--

- Chats generate conversational engagement (higher cognitive and social proocessing)

---

# 3. Twitter chats

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/timing.png")
```

### Perils

--

- Volume may be too high (i.e., 360 tweets/hour = a new tweet every 10 seconds)

--

- Less connecting to broader perspectives during a chat (i.e., fewer mentions, hashtags, hyperlinks)

### Possibilities

--

- Reddit communities are big and growing (despite fewer posts in r/education)

--

- Variety of topics, potentially something for everyone

--

- Moderated space may improve focus and quality of conversation

--

- Anonymity may increase honesty in sharing

--

- Continuity and change of various measures in relationship with each other may suggest more nuanced interpretation

---

# 5. Reddit communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/across-time.jpg")
```

### Perils

--

- Uneven experience between communities and within communities

--

- Overwhelmingly predominant sharing of hyperlinks alone in r/education

--

- Anonymity may increase toxicity in sharing

--

- Online participation can change quickly, meaning a snapshot may be misleading

# Possibilities

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/chat.jpg")
```

--

- Many online communities are big, sustained, growing.

--

-	**For participants:** There's something for everyone: resources, links to articles, conversations, encouragement, social hang outs

--

-	**For researchers:** Public behavior, open to study, big complex data

---

# Perils

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/caution.jpg")
```

--

- **Equity** issues are foregrounded: takes time to self-direct learning and build informal online communities &mdash; *Who has time to keep up?*

--

-	**For participants:** Uneven experience: spam, self-promotion, sharing links without context or comment

--

-	**For researchers:** Complicated and nuanced ethical concerns get raised

I will **develop digital literacies** for teachers coming into the field

--

- Create recommendations for using social media to pursue the possibilities of networked learning and avoid the perils:

--

- Create guidelines for emergency disaster response (e.g., pandemic)

--

- Create guidelines for job transitions: e.g., new teachers, new faculty, promotions (in progress)

---

# Equity

I will **develop communities focused on equity** 

--

- Create recommendations for building and facilitating online communities that address inequities

--

- Leverage research findings to incorporate social media features (e.g., moderation) to increase inclusivity

--

- Research motivations of participation by "lurkers" to better engage them
